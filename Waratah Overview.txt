Overview:
The goal of the application is to have referrals entered on the homepage, then have admin assign them to a Practitioner when the contractor signs in, 
they can see the clients assigned to them then add an Occasion of Service, view the previous Occasions of Service they have provided to them or run a report.

Working:
So basically what we are doing in this is once we submit the referral form we have all the referrals listed on the home page where admin assign the clients
to a particular Practitioner(Contractor). Then if we have same client (First Name, Sur Name and DOB same) then we have added a functionality here to merge that
client with the existing one (Waratah Screenshots(Fig 1.1)).

After signing in as a Practitioner(Contractor) we have listing of all clients that have been assigned to the signed in Practitioner(Contractor) and add occasion of
service for each client. We can also view each client os(occasion ofservice) history and add os. We have os Reports section in it which shows all the os records 
of the Practitioner(Contractor) signed in. 

Now as a admin part we have report section for admin where he can view all the os of all the Practitioner(Contractor) and also export them.
